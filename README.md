# ðŸ”¬ CHE251 Project â€“ Simulation of Methanol/DME to Olefins

A detailed simulation study of **Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO)** and **Dimethyl Ether-to-Olefins (DMTO)** processes
- **Mentor:** Prof. Harshwardhan H. Katkar


---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Simulate and compare two modern olefin production processes â€” **MTO** and **DMTO** â€” using DWSIM.
- Evaluate reaction yield, feedstock flexibility, environmental impact, and operational feasibility.
- Identify which process performs better in terms of **olefin yield and efficiency**.

## ðŸ§ª Project Sections

### 1. MTO: Methanol to Olefins
- Reforming of shale gas to synthesis gas (CO + Hâ‚‚)
- Methanol synthesis from syngas
- Catalytic dehydration of methanol to produce ethylene and propylene
- Flowsheet designed in DWSIM with conversion reactor & flash separators
- **Advantages:** Good ROI, energy integration, high selectivity with SAPO-34 catalyst
- **Challenges:** No packed bed reactor, catalyst limitations, workaround via conversion models

### 2. DMTO: Dimethyl Ether to Olefins
- Additional methanol-to-DME dehydration step
- DME converted to light olefins using SAPO-34 catalyst
- Improved yield efficiency over MTO with fewer byproducts
- **Advantages:** Greater selectivity, lower energy consumption, flexible feedstocks (coal/gas/biomass)
- **Challenges:** Complex flow separation and reactor conditions
